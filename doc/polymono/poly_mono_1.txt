# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Assuming you want to set 2 groups of channels
# Group 1: first channel 5 in poly mode, only one channel
# Group 2: first channel 10 in mono mode , only one channel

# Group 1 should have following settings:
# basic channel 5, mode poly, omni off, (mode 2).

# Group 2 should have the following settings:
# basic channel 10, mode mono, omni off, (mode 3), composed of one channel.

# Use command resetbasicchannels using numbered mode:
resetbasicchannels  5 2 0   10 3 1
# or Using named mode:
resetbasicchannels  5 poly_omnioff 0   10 mono_omnioff 1

# Use basicchannels command to verify your settings
basicchannels


# end
