Bugs, errors, and incomplete code
---------------------------------

- Add support for "loop till release" instruments (currently broken)
- Get TCP server working for windows
- The synth consumes too much CPU when no voices are playing. 
- Multi-channel audio output
- Filter on/off optimization causes clicks 
- Phase sync'ed samples should start simultaneously.

Validation
----------

- Validation tests: create soundfont with basic wave forms [sine,
  square, triangle]; make test midi file; compare with SBLive output;
  "regression" test
- Validate reverb
- Validate chorus
- compare performance with timidity

JG:
> Its often hard to get the right Reverb/Chorus/Gain settings as
> well, so often I end up turning off Reverb and Chorus which can help.

JG:
> Well actually, it almost seems like every instrument is kind of flat. It
> just doesn't sound real nice. 


Documentation
-------------

- Multi-channel audio output
- Write documention on tuning
- fluid_synth_program_select2() with name of soundfont instead of font_id
- fluid_synth_set_gen2()
- Web site
- Documentation and announcement Virtools and Director
- Add usage scenarios in the documentation
- User and system configuration file

Binaries
--------

- FluidSynth 
  * Linux 
  * Win
  * MacOS X
- fluid~  (Pd/Linux, MaxMSP/MacOSX, MaxMSP/Windows)
- fluidsynth~ (MaxMSP/MacOSX, MaxMSP/Windows)
- FluidXtra

- old distributions

Requests
--------

- Add compatibility for EMU8k volume attenuation parameter which
  doesn't follow SoundFont specifications
- Remove dependency of settings on audio driver and other (see
  fluid_settings_init())
- Add "unselect" command to shell to set a MIDI channel to not sound.
- When specifying -i -s (no console and TCP server) log to TCP clients
  with easier parsable messages ("warning:", "error:", etc)
- GM soundfont? 
- MacOS X MidiCore component
- Windows DirectMusic component
- add function to get initial soundfont generator value
- ASIO driver
- DirectSound 3D and EAX
- Pause and resume the synthesizer/audio thread (run synthesizer as a daemon)

- set loop on/off on a sample (1 - with name sample, 2 - name sf and name preset)     Use set_gen?

  set_gen: GEN_SAMPLEMODE (54): 
       Loop during release: 1,
       Loop: 3
       No loop: 0 and all other values,





Fluid 1.1:
--------------------------------------------

SFLoader API:
- "interface" api
- redo sfloader api using "interface" api

Sample streaming
- sample streaming, load/unload sample on demand 

Design
- turn ladspa fx unit and router in indepedent 
  objects, remove their dependencies from the synth object

MIDI player
- Add API to manipulate and query MIDI file list
- generalize use of fluid_event_t, remove fluid_midi_event_t

Shell & command handler
- Add "note" command that plays a note with a duration (sequencer)
- MIDI file player commands (load/play/stop)
- Relax dependency of the command handler on the synthesizer
- Allow settings to be loaded before the synthesizer is created

SoundFont Specs:
- pitch control on stereo samples not managed as should

MIDI Specs
- handle tuning sysex messages
- OMNI
- sample dump

Unsorted
- Analyse/improve voice stealing algorithm (soft and hard limits?)
- change sample rate dynamically after jack driver instantiation, or
  create audio driver before initiating the synth
- include readline in project
- additional aux buses
- rewrite midi file using new sequencer
- direct access to audio buffer
- soft clipping, compressor, limitor, or automatic gain control
- 96kHz/24bits
- OpenSoundControl
